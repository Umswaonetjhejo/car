# car
Program to start the car, stop the car, and quit.

The program is an interactive command-line interface designed to control the state of a car (starting and stopping it) and to provide basic information about available commands. Here's a summary of what the program is for:

1. It allows the user to input commands such as "start," "stop," "quit," or "help."

2. If the user inputs "start," it checks whether the car is already started or not. If the car is already started, it informs the user. Otherwise, it starts the car.

3. If the user inputs "stop," it checks whether the car is already stopped or not. If the car is already stopped, it informs the user. Otherwise, it stops the car.

4. If the user inputs "quit," it exits the program.

5. If the user inputs "help," it provides a list of available commands.

6. For any other input, it informs the user that the command is not understood.

The primary purpose of the program is to simulate basic car control and provide information about the available commands to the user.
